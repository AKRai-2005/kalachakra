"""What a results file needs in order to be regenerable later.

A number you cannot reproduce is not a measurement, and this project has twice
been caught out by a missing knob: experiment 14 here did
not record its epoch count and could not regenerate its own published row, and
in October 2026 a lead-time figure could not be attributed to either a library
upgrade or a thread count because neither was written down.

`environment()` returns the things that silently decide a result:

  versions      only of libraries the run actually imported, so the record
                describes this run rather than the machine's package list
  threads       torch's thread count and the OpenMP/MKL variables, because
                fused kernels and XGBoost reduce floats in thread order and a
                different count gives a different answer
  git           the commit the run was made from, and whether the tree was
                dirty, so a row can be traced to code

Every experiment merges this into its payload under "environment".
